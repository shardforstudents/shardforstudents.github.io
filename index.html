Since 2004, over 300 high school students have worked in our research labs and learned about the process of science first hand. We offer several different options, with different areas of focus and time commitments. Regularly we have talks, lab tours, and field trips as a groupc.

            <th class="content">Each year, we host a group of talented young individuals who are interested in the fields of stem cell biology, regenerative medicine, and biomedical research. In our research laboratory, these interns work side-by-side with experienced clinician/scientist mentors, who will challenge, inspire and guide them on their first steps toward a career in medicine and biomedical research.
            We look to identify individuals that possess tenacity and drive, enthusiasm and curiosity. Prior lab experience is not a prerequisite because we recognize that some students don’t have the same opportunities as others to explore hands-on science. Passion, however, is essential: we have found that when you’re really interested in something, you’ll invest more time and energy- and with that added effort invariably comes success.<br>Curiosity is also important. Every scientist, entrepreneur, inventor, and creator will tell you that inquisitiveness, that willingness to think in new and different ways, is the most valuable characteristic you can possess. When it is coupled with perseverance and determination, there’s no telling what you can learn about science and medicine- and also about yourself.

Formerly affiliated with CHORI, now fully integrated with the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, this summer program provides a one-on-one mentorship with health care providers and researchers, along with access to unique workshops, seminars, trainings, simulations, and networking opportunities. The program culminates in a formal research symposium in which each student presents their project findings to the scientific community, many of which continue on as future grants, publications, and advances in healthcare. The overall goal of the program is to stimulate interest in health sciences for under-represented students, arming them with professional skills and confidence, thereby improving their likelihood of success in STEM careers.
